## Problem Statement
One of the major features of cryptocurrencies is that they are decentralized. This means they are not controlled by a single institution like a government or central bank, but instead are divided among a variety of computers, networks and nodes.\
A decentralized autonomous organizations i.e DAO is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain.\
We have created GovDAO, similar to the DAO used by the likes of AAVE, Compound and many existing crypto projects. It has its own GOV token and an integrated governance framework.\
Prominent features of GovDAO
    - GOV, an ERC20 token used for voting by community.
    - Any GOV holder can create proposals for DAO.
    - Limited voting period for a proposal.
    - All GOV holders can vote on a proposal.
    - It helps the community reach consensus over a decision.

## Technology Stack
- Solidity 
- ReactJS
- Web3
- Truffle Suite
- Polygon

## Conclusion
We developed a scalable governance framework for a DAO using smart contracts deployed on polygon blockchain. The user experience for the application is also very intuitive for the users.
- Key Benefits
    - Unlike traditional organizations where only top board members get a vote in the decision making, a DAO includes all the members in the decision making process.
    - It provides a way to reach consensus in a large decentralised organization.
    - Lets the community members decide on how to use funds from organization's treasury.
    - The smart contracts are opoen source and publicly verifiable via block explorers which makes the DAO transparent, secure and fair to everyone.
