# Governance framework for a DAO

## About DAO in general
A Decentralized Autonomous Organizations i.e DAO is an organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. Unlike traditional organizations where we have Top-Down heirarchy for decision making, in a DAO decision making process is carried out Bottom-Up. You can imagine every shareholder, every employee, no matter how small in the board meeting and everyone gets a say in the decision. But the voting power is directly proportional to the shares (tokens) owned by them.

## GovDAO
GovDAO is similar to the DAOs used by the likes of AAVE, Compound Finance and many existing crypto projects. The User Interface is actually a clone of Compound Finance's Governance forum since it is really intuitive to use. It has its own GOV token and an integrated governance framework.

Prominent features of GovDAO
- GOV, an ERC20 token used for voting by community.
- The DAO has a treasury, which can be spent via passed proposals.
- Any GOV holder can create proposals for DAO with intital stake.
- All GOV holders can vote on a proposal using their tokens.
- Tokens used for voting  are locked in user's accounts for the voting period to prevent double voting.
- Time limited voting on proposals.
- Only one proposal at a time.
- The proposal not only needs to have more votes in favour than against, but also has to pass Quorum.
- Quorum is the minimum number of tokens that are required in favour of the proposal to get it passed.
- If the proposal is rejected, the inital stake of the proposer is slashed and goes to treasury.
- Associated fixed rate exchange, where you can buy/sell GOV

## Key Benefits
- Unlike traditional organizations where only top board members get a vote in the decision making, a DAO includes all the members in the decision making process.
- It provides a way to reach consensus in a large decentralised organization of anonymous individuals.
- Lets the community members decide on how to use funds from organization's treasury.
- The smart contracts are open source and publicly verifiable via block explorers which makes the DAO transparent, secure and fair to everyone.
